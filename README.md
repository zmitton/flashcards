## Flashcards

Formats word lists into a document that can be printed onto standard business-card-paper (10 per sheet)


### Use

- coerce your text into the format see in the `words.txt` file
- run the `index.js` file using $ `node index.js`
- open the `flashcardHtml.html` file (which it creates) in a browser (chrome recommended)
- print the page using a printer that is capable of printing on two sides (check the preview to make sure everything is correct)
